# Hadoop Docker Compose
## description
this small project aims at providing an easy way to use hadoop without complicated manipulations and without risking to compromise an existing system
## requirements
Docker and its Compose plugins must be installed
## installation
it may be required to chmod the run file  
```console
chmod u+x ./run.sh
```
## start project
### beware !
it may be necessary to wait a bit less than a minute before being able to use the machine (on the first run, expect a ten-minute long start, which corresponds to time necessary to copy hadoop files)
### command
this command should open a hadoop terminal  
```console
./run.sh`
```
